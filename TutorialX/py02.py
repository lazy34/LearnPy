#Suppose i have three varible ,But it doesn't require to assign them separately

# name:"Lazy"
# age=20
# Coder=True
#That's the way to assign them separately

#But another way to assign them

# name,age,Coder="Lazy",20,True
# print(name,age,Coder)


#Next is assign same value in different variable
# a=b=c=30
# print(a)
